# Solar-Tracking-Device
A Solar-Tracking Device optimizes solar panel's orientation by adjusting their angle to follow the sun throughout the day, maximizing sunlight exposure and increasing energy output. Trackers can be single-axis or dual-axis and are used in residential, commercial, and utility-scale solar systems for greater efficiency compared to fixed panels.
